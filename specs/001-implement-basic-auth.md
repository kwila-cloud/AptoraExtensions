# Basic Authentication

**Status**: pending

## Description

Implement basic authentication system to secure access to Aptora Extensions. This will prevent unauthorized access to sensitive Aptora data while maintaining low friction for legitimate users. POC (spec 000) runs without authentication on internal network only - this spec addresses production security requirements.

## Design Decisions

TBD - could we use Aptora's users somehow? Password hash algorithm unknown.

## Task List

TBD
