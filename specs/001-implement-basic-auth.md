# Basic Authentication

**Status**: Planned (Post-POC)

Implement basic authentication system to secure access to Aptora Extensions.

## Goals

- Prevent unauthorized access to Aptora data
- Simple user management
- Minimal friction for legitimate users

## Notes

- Aptora database has users and hashed passwords, but hash algorithm is unknown
- Do NOT attempt to use Aptora passwords directly
- POC will run without authentication (internal network only)

## Task List

TBD
